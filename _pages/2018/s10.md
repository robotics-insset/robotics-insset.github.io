## Description

This course will introduce and detail some of the main topics in robotic perception, namely 
1. sensors (odometry, RGB and RGB-D cameras, IMU, LiDAR), 
2. sensor fusion, 
3. geometric localization and mapping (SLAM), 
4. semantic mapping.

## What Will I Learn?

>- Understand the main distinctive features of robot perception
>- Understand the particularities of the most common robotic sensors
>- Fuse the information from several sensors
>- Understand the main components of a robotic perception system
>- Estimate the localization of a robot and a map of its surroundings from one or several sensors
>- Estimate a scene map with semantic content
