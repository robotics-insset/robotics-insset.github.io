## Description

A introductory course to automatic control theory for linear systems. The students will learn how to model and describe practical systems with classical linear tools. And based on that, linear control techniques like PD, PID will be introduced to realize automatic control of these linear systems. TD classes will be provided to help better understand and master the learned knowledge and skills.

## Prerequisites

> 1. Basic knowledge of Linear Algebra
- operations of vectors (sum, product)
- operations of matrices (sum, product, inverse matrix)
- operations of vector and matrix (product)
2. Knowledge about complex numbers and Laplace transform
